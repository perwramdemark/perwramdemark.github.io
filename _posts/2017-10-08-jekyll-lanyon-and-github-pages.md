Finally got this website up and runnig thanks to Jekyll, Lanyon and Github Pages. They have all been around for a couple of years, but I have missed them.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. 

[Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) is the theme used for this web site. Great looking and perfect for a small blog site.

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) is hosting the web site, so it's all administered and version controlled through Github.
